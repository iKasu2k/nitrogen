    <h4>A small tool to generate and check Discord Nitro Gift Codes automatically using TOR as proxy. </h4>
</center>

## Why NitroGen :question:
Traditional scrapers require a list of proxies or utilize free proxy websites to send anonymous requests. In most cases, those free proxies are most likely non-working or getting blocked relatively fast. Finding good and reliable proxies on the other hand can be time consuming or cost intensive.

To circumvent this issue, NitroGen will spawn a previously defined amount of TOR Nodes, each providing a socks5 proxy to be used to send requests to Discord. Each Node is configured to change its IP Address every 10 seconds, allowing to send subsequent requests without being rate limited. With 8 Nodes, ~2-3 requests were sent each second.

## Install Instructions :wrench:
Before running the Scraper, please make sure you meet the pre requirements to avoid any conflicts while running the scraper. 
TOR must be installed and the user running the scraper requires permission to invoke `tor` on the command line via `child_process.exec`
### Pre Requirements :exclamation:
Please make sure you've TOR installed on your system and can be invoked using `tor` in the command line!
Most Linux distributions provide a package that can be installed using the system package manager, for example: 

```sh
# Debian, Ubuntu, etc.
$ apt install tor
```
```sh
# Fedora
$ dnf install tor
```
```sh
# CentOS, RHEL, ...
$ yum install tor
```
```sh
# Gentoo
$ emerge tor
```
```sh
# Arch Linux
$ pacman -S tor
```

### Setup
Fork `master` branch into your personal repository or clone it directly from the main repository. Install node modules.

```javascript
$ git clone https://github.com/iKasu2k/nitrogen.git
$ cd nitrogen
$ npm install
```

## Usage :package:
#### TOR Nodes
The amount of TOR Nodes spawned is controlled via the ENV variable TOR_COUNT. Default start script will set TOR_COUNT to 8. If TOR_COUNT is not set, the scraper will not start!
TOR Data Directory will be written to `/src/res/.tor/{i}`.

#### Start Scraper in CLI
To start the TOR Nodes and the Scraper, simply run the following command:
```sh
$ npm run start
```

#### :exclamation: If any errors occur or a kill signal is received, the scraper will stop sending requests, kill TOR Nodes an will wait for user Input.
